Dear SCF Mentoring Subcommittee,

We are writing to express our interested to attend the two-day training course in December 2015 as one group composed of:

* Mike Croucher (https://github.com/mikecroucher on GitHub)
* Jez Cope ([jezcope](https://github.com/jezcope) on GitHub)
* Will Furnass ([willfurnass](https://github.com/willfurnass) on GitHub)
* David Jones ([drj11](https://github.com/drj11) on GitHub)
* Drew Leonard ([drewleonard42](https://github.com/drewleonard42) on GitHub)
* Anna Krystalli ([annakrystalli](https://github.com/annakrystalli) on GitHub)


Mike Croucher is a Research Software Engineer at University of Sheffield. He arranged the first ever MATLAB-based Software Carpentry event in collaboration with Mathworks at University of Manchester in 2014, see http://www.walkingrandomly.com/?p=5324 for details. He was subsequently involved in arranging and teaching a MATLAB Software Carpentry event at University of Sheffield in 2015. He has previously completed the Software Carpentry training and is taking part on this group in a coordination role. He will work to ensure that the Software Carpentry events promised are delivered and will take part in teaching.

Jez Cope is Research Data Manager in the University of Sheffield Library. In a former life he did computational systems biology research and assisted in teaching undergraduates Java and Haskell (obtaining a PG Cert. in Higher Education for his troubles), and now co-ordinates research data management activity across the University of Sheffield, including planning and delivering a programme of training for postgraduate and early-career researchers. He is helping out with the first ever [Library Carpentry](http://librarycarpentry.github.io/city-november-2015/) course, which aims to teach librarians to code. He also [blogs sporadically](http://erambler.co.uk).

Will Furnass is a [Post-Doctoral Research Associate in Civil and Structural Engineering](https://www.shef.ac.uk/civil/staff/research/furnassw) at the University of Sheffield.  His somewhat non-linear career path has taken in a computer science undergraduate degree, several years of IT systems engineering (so he is very familiar with Bash/Linux) and a PhD in water engineering (which involved numerical modelling using Python).  In October, he was a Helper at a [Data Carpentry workshop in Leeds](http://hpcarcher.github.io/2015-10-29-Leeds-DC/).  Other teaching experience includes: [running soft skills workshops](http://www.sheffield.ac.uk/ssid/301/services/workshops) at the University, trying to get civil engineers interested in things like [research data management](https://github.com/willfurnass/RDMPresentationApr2014) and version control, and lecturing on water-engineering-related subjects.  He is a member of the Python Sheffield group.

David Jones is a Research Software Engineer
in the Hide Lab for Computational Biology
in the University of Sheffield.
His current position follows a maths degree
and more than 20 years in industry
programming a variety of things
(near real-time garbage collectors, video games, robotics,
and, most recently, data oriented web apps).
David loves Python, shell, and all things programmatical.
He is passionate about bringing the joys of programming to a wider
and more diverse audience. David has been a helper and an
instructor at two previous Software Carpentry workshops.

Drew Leonard is a Post-Doctoral Research Associate in Solar Physics at the University of Sheffield. He has made several contributions to [SunPy](http://sunpy.org), an open-source solar physics library written in Python, which he used extensively for his PhD. Drew organised several short Python courses for students and staff during his PhD, as well as assissting with existing undergraduate coding modules. He also ran a Software Carpentry-style SunPy workshop held at Sheffield in March, and is currently arranging another of these workshops for January.

[Anna Krystalli](http://www.annakrystalli.com/overview.html) is now a postdoc after completing a PhD at the Department of Animal & Plant Science, University of Sheffield, in the field of macroecology. The field is highly computational (primarily in R) and often involves working with large and disparate datasets. Outside of academia she has also held posts as a quality assurance auditor for contract research organisations so is particularly interested in current drives to promote reproducibility, transparency, robust workflows and sound data management in science. Sheâ€™s been involved in teaching on a variety of courses including [postgraduate level courses in advanced statistics in R](http://www.r4all.org/the-courses/) and undergraduate [marine ecology field courses](https://www.shef.ac.uk/aps/currentug/level3/aps350). She also co-developed and delivered a one day [data management and open science in R](http://figshare.com/articles/Research_Data_Management_in_R/1600906) workshop for [ACCE DTP](https://acce.shef.ac.uk/) postgraduate students.

If we are selected for the instructor training we will use a meeting room in the Husband Building at The University of Sheffield as a venue. The room and AV equipment have already been booked.

We are planning to organize three workshops at the beginning of 2016:

* Python based Software Carpentry (Focusing on participants from one academic subject)
* Python based Software Carpentry (For participants from a range of disciplines)
* Data Carpentry

These events will be co-ordinated via our [github organisation](https://github.com/SheffieldSoftwareCarpentry) which was also used to co-ordinate this application. 

Mike Croucher will soon present a 'Research Software Manifesto' to the Faculty Executive Board of the Faculty of Engineering at the University of Sheffield. The provision of quality research software training is at the core of this manifesto. If we are successful in this application, this training course and the subsequent software carpentry events will be used as case studies for a business case recommending that the University of Sheffield become a Software Carpentry Affiliate.

Thank you for your consideration.
