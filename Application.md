Dear SCF Mentoring Subcommittee,

We are writing to express our interested to attend the two-day training course in December 2015 as one group composed of:

* Mike Croucher (https://github.com/mikecroucher on GitHub)
* Jez Cope ([jezcope](https://github.com/jezcope) on GitHub)
* Will Furnass ([willfurnass](https://github.com/willfurnass) on GitHub)
* Anna Krystalli ([annakrystalli](https://github.com/annakrystalli) on GitHub),
* NAME_OF_5TH_STUDENT (GITHUB_ID on GitHub) and
* NAME_OF_6TH_STUDENT (GITHUB_ID on GitHub).

THIS SECTION IS TO GIVE DETAILS OF OUR SC-RELATED EXPERIENCE

Mike Croucher is a Research Software Engineer at University of Sheffield. He arranged the first ever MATLAB-based Software Carpentry event in collaboration with Mathworks at University of Manchester in 2014, see http://www.walkingrandomly.com/?p=5324 for details. He was subsequently involved in arranging and teaching a MATLAB Software Carpentry event at University of Sheffield in 2015. He has previously completed the Software Carpentry training and is taking part on this group in a coordination role. He will work to ensure that the Software Carpentry events promised are delivered and will take part in teaching.

Jez Cope is Research Data Manager in the University of Sheffield Library. In a former life he did computational systems biology research and assisted in teaching undergraduates Java and Haskell (obtaining a PG Cert. in Higher Education for his troubles), and now co-ordinates research data management activity across the University of Sheffield, including planning and delivering a programme of training for postgraduate and early-career researchers. He is helping out with the first ever [Library Carpentry](http://librarycarpentry.github.io/city-november-2015/) course, which aims to teach librarians to code. He also [blogs sporadically](http://erambler.co.uk).

Will Furnass is a [Post-Doctoral Research Associate in Civil and Structural Engineering](https://www.shef.ac.uk/civil/staff/research/furnassw) at the University of Sheffield.  His somewhat non-linear career path has taken in a computer science undergraduate degree, several years of IT systems engineering (so he is very familiar with Bash/Linux) and a PhD in water engineering (which involved numerical modelling using Python).  In October, he was a Helper at a [Data Carpentry workshop in Leeds](http://hpcarcher.github.io/2015-10-29-Leeds-DC/).  Other teaching experience includes: [running soft skills](http://www.sheffield.ac.uk/ssid/301/services/workshops) workshops at the University, trying to get civil engineers interested in things like [research data management](https://github.com/willfurnass/RDMPresentationApr2014), and version control and lecturing on water-engineering-related subjects.

[Anna Krystalli](http://www.annakrystalli.com/overview.html) is now a postdoc after completing a PhD at the Department of Animal & Plant Science, University of Sheffield, in the field of macroecology. The field is highly computational (primarily in R) and often involves working with large and disparate datasets. Outside of academia she has also held posts as a quality assurance auditor for contract research organisations so is particularly interested in current drives to promote reproducibility, transparency, robust workflows and sound data management in science. Sheâ€™s been involved in teaching on a variety of courses including [postgraduate level courses in advanced statistics in R](http://www.r4all.org/the-courses/) and undergraduate [marine ecology field courses](https://www.shef.ac.uk/aps/currentug/level3/aps350). She also co-developed and delivered a one day [data management and open science in R](http://figshare.com/articles/Research_Data_Management_in_R/1600906) workshop for [ACCE DTP](https://acce.shef.ac.uk/) postgraduate students.

If we are selected for the instructor training we will use the conference room of our department that you can check below. We already made reservations for that room in advance. (TODO)

We are planing to organize three workshops at the beginning of 2016:

* Python based Software Carpentry (Subject specific)
* Python based Software Carpentry (Open access)
* Data Carpentry

(More details of these will need to be given as part of the application.)

ADDITIONAL NOTES THAT MAY AID OUR APPLICATION

* Using this to bootstrap a SC-related community at University of Sheffield.
* We have a github organisation which we'll use to co-ordinate SC effort at Sheffield.

Thanks for your consideration.
