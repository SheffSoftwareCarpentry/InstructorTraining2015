THIS SECTION IS TO GIVE DETAILS OF OUR SC-RELATED EXPERIENCE

Mike Croucher is a Research Software Engineer at University of Sheffield. He arranged the first ever MATLAB-based Software Carpentry event in collaboration with Mathworks at University of Manchester in 2014, see http://www.walkingrandomly.com/?p=5324 for details. He was subsequently involved in arranging and teaching a MATLAB Software Carpentry event at University of Sheffield in 2015. He has previously completed the Software Carpentry training and is taking part on this group in a coordination role. He will work to ensure that the Software Carpentry events promised are delivered and will take part in teaching.

If we are selected for the instructor training we will use the conference room of our department that you can check below. We already made reservations for that room in advance. (TODO)

We are planing to organize three workshops at the beginning of 2016:

* Python based Software Carpentry (Subject specific)
* Python based Software Carpentry (Open access)
* Data Carpentry

(More details of these will need to be given as part of the application.)

ADDITIONAL NOTES THAT MAY AID OUR APPLICATION

* Using this to bootstrap a SC-related community at University of Sheffield.
* We have a github organisation which we'll use to co-ordinate SC effort at Sheffield.

Thanks for your consideration.
