We must all watch one of the two videos below and submit a paragraph of feedback on the video they chose to watch as part of their application.

 * a: https://vimeo.com/139316669
 * b: https://vimeo.com/139181120

We submit these as part of the individual surveys but reproduce them here for the benefit of all.

I watched video b. The presenter explained very clearly the usage of each command and the relevant options. It was also good that he repeated the commands a few times to demonstrate how the commands worked with different options. However, previous commands and their output were soon lost past the top of the screen, which might make it more difficult for people who have fallen behind to catch up. I would also expand a little on the explanation of why excel or similar would bnot be suitable for the sorting task, since people tend to need a good reason to move away from using a tool they already know how to use.

I watched video 'a'.  Delivering an interactive tutorial using Jupyter Notebooks is a great idea: code can be clearly distinguished from results and students can follow along, possibly experimenting if the session's moving too slow for them.  The instructor reacted very quickly and well to questions regarding array dimensionality, providing clarifying examples and asking questions to test comprehension.  Students were forthcoming with responses and other queries, an indication of good rapport in the room.  However, the instructor's questions only tested the comprehension of those that verbally responded; an online poll later in the session would help confirm that all are keeping up.  Common mistakes (e.g. Python using half-open ranges) were well highlighted.  Sessions were well sequenced so that ndarrays could be presented in terms of their similarities to semi-familiar concepts (lists).  I might have briefly mentioned similar datastructures in other high-level research computing languages and relevant differences (e.g. 0/1-based indexing): this would be of use if students were already somewhat familiar with e.g. Matlab or R and could help students translate ideas from the session to other languages.
