I watched video 'a'.  Delivering an interactive tutorial using Jupyter Notebooks is a great idea: code can be clearly distinguished from results and students can follow along, possibly experimenting if the session's moving too slow for them.  The instructor reacted very quickly and well to questions regarding array dimensionality, providing clarifying examples and asking questions to test comprehension.  Students were forthcoming with responses and other queries, an indication of good rapport in the room.  However, the instructor's questions only tested the comprehension of those that verbally responded; an online poll later in the session would help confirm that all are keeping up.  Common mistakes (e.g. Python using half-open ranges) were well highlighted.  Sessions were well sequenced so that ndarrays could be presented in terms of their similarities to semi-familiar concepts (lists).  I might have briefly mentioned similar datastructures in other high-level research computing languages and relevant differences (e.g. 0/1-based indexing): this would be of use if students were already somewhat familiar with e.g. Matlab or R and could help students translate ideas from the session to other languages.
