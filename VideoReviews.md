We must all watch one of the two videos below and submit a paragraph of feedback on the video they chose to watch as part of their application.

 * a: https://vimeo.com/139316669
 * b: https://vimeo.com/139181120

We submit these as part of the individual surveys but reproduce them here for the benefit of all.

## Mike's Feedback

I watched video 'b'. The presentation is very clear and well-paced. I like how he starts with simple examples which are built up to more complex analysis. The sorting example was not well thought out since 'sort' and 'sort -n' in this instance produced the same result. It would have been better to engineer data that gave different output. He refers to man pages as a way of answering the audience's questions - something that I think is good practice since it encourages them to do this too.

## Jez's Feedback

I watched video 'b'. Overall a good, confident delivery and the instructor dealt well with questions from the audience. The instructor did spend quite a lot of time checking the lesson plan, but this will improve with more practice. The individual commands are explained well, but I feel this whole section would be easier to remember with a slight restructure:

1. State the intended task (find the file with the most lines), and make it a genuinely useful task (counting the lines in a `.pdb` file doesn't seem that useful)
2. Show the full pipeline to do this, execute it (to show it works) and talk through the high level logic (count the lines in each file, sort numerically, pick the last file in the list): the diagram in the lecture notes might be useful at this point
3. *Then* build up the pipeline one command at a time, explaining them in detail as you go
4. Show the full pipeline again to summarise
5. Give some specific additional task for people to try and achieve by modifying the basic pipeline if they get it working quickly

This structure would make the lesson flow better and provide a clearer recall structure to help learners remember the material. Redirection to a file could be introduced either at the start or at the end, but switching to pipes halfway through I felt broke up the flow a bit. Also, on a data management note: we could encourage good practice by showing people a `README` file or other documentation/metadata in the directory alongside the example data files.

## David's Feedback

I watched video B: https://vimeo.com/139181120

The split screen video
showing the projector in one big rectangle
and the presenter in a smaller rectangle
works well,
and is a good way to video presentations
for sharing.
I like the, brief, recap at the beginning,
and the preview of what is to come.
There were a couple of awkward pauses
where it appeared that
the instructor was looking for what to do next,
losing flow and
appearing slight unconfident. 
On a technical level,
when discussing a particular part of a command,
moving the cursor to
the part under discussion
(a "*" in this case)
worked really well;
referring to the man page was also good.
The large terminal displays was good
(I've seen too many presentations go sour
because the letters were too small)
but the terminal should stretch all the way to the bottom!
Towards the end,
when constructing a pipeline,
the instructor makes an error with wc;
this would've been a good moment to explain the error,
explain the output,
and what went wrong.

## Anna's Feedback

a) I liked the use of IPython (Jupyter) notebooks so that participants could follow and interact with the material in the session. I also liked the frequent recapping of previously covered material especially through asking questions of participants. Ensuring material was clearly visible by asking for feedback from participants was also good. She gave well rounded responses to participants questions and provided informative demonstration of the principles she was trying to explain. Good thinking on her feet. I would probably follow very similar approaches but I generally try to be slightly more enthusiastic and animated when teaching.

## Drew's Feedback

I watched video b. The presenter explained very clearly the usage of each command and the relevant options. It was also good that he repeated the commands a few times to demonstrate how the commands worked with different options. However, previous commands and their output were soon lost past the top of the screen, which might make it more difficult for people who have fallen behind to catch up. I would also expand a little on the explanation of why excel or similar would bnot be suitable for the sorting task, since people tend to need a good reason to move away from using a tool they already know how to use.

## Will's Feedback

I watched video 'a'.  Delivering an interactive tutorial using Jupyter Notebooks is a great idea: code can be clearly distinguished from results and students can follow along, possibly experimenting if the session's moving too slow for them.  The instructor reacted very quickly and well to questions regarding array dimensionality, providing clarifying examples and asking questions to test comprehension.  Students were forthcoming with responses and other queries, an indication of good rapport in the room.  However, the instructor's questions only tested the comprehension of those that verbally responded; an online poll later in the session would help confirm that all are keeping up.  Common mistakes (e.g. Python using half-open ranges) were well highlighted.  Sessions were well sequenced so that ndarrays could be presented in terms of their similarities to semi-familiar concepts (lists).  I might have briefly mentioned similar datastructures in other high-level research computing languages and relevant differences (e.g. 0/1-based indexing): this would be of use if students were already somewhat familiar with e.g. Matlab or R and could help students translate ideas from the session to other languages.
